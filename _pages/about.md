I am a graduate student at [Northeastern University](http://www.northeastern.edu/) in the [Khoury College of Computer Sciences](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/). I started at Northeastern in Fall of 2018. Before that I was a Software Engineer at [BlueTalon](https://bluetalon.com/) building a secure authorization layer for enterprise data storage. Currently, I'm doing research with Professor [Cristina Nita-Rotaru](http://cnitarot.github.io/) in the [Networks and Distributed Systems Security](https://nds2.ccs.neu.edu/) lab.

My current research project is focused on security and privacy of payment channel networks, which are related to--but not the same as--blockchains. More generally, I'm interested in the security of distributed systems and computer networks.

I have BS in Electrical Engineering from the [University of Iowa](https://uiowa.edu/).
